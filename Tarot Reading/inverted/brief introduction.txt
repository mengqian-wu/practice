The idea of creating this final project is generated by the need of spiritual guidance game using tarot cards. 
It would be convenient if I used the frame of tarot rules, and let the system automatically draw three cards, representing the past state, present state, and the future state. 

The logic of picking three cards was straightforward. The main time and effor I spend on this project was on tkinter print-out and the explanation logic. 
Three cards should be either uprighted or inverted. 
When the card is uprighted, the bright side meanings will show. When the card is inverted, the dark side meanings will show. 
For the meaning of each card, I stored three key words for each side, and six key words total for each card. It could give a general vibe of each card's spirit. 

The final report for player is designed as a mad-libs game. In the coding script, I left several blanks and when you ran the code, the words representing your cards will fill in the blank. 
So, it is logically consistent. Because the final report should consider all three cards togher, I shuffle the order of encoding the words. 
Depending on the word property, the paragraph was designed to be friendly to read. 

It definitely can be more complex, if you add more meaning to each card or define more rules in the report paragraph.
